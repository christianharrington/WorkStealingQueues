\label{sec:testing}
Testing parallel algorithms with shared mutable state can be challenging. By using unit testing, we have been able to find many issues when running our cases with a single or few threads. The problems arise due to the many possible interleavings when running with many threads. During our final benchmarks, we encountered issues when running with more than 48 threads. Due to the nature of the bug, we did not have time to find a solution. This issue might have been found earlier, and fixed, if we had used an automatic testing solution that can test all possible interleavings. Microsoft CHESS\todo{Ref} can be used in .Net to test many possible interleavings. For the JVM, NASA has developed Java Path Finder. Both these tools can force certain interleavings, making it much easier to find the kind of bug we encountered. Unfortunately, Java Path Finder is very difficult to set up, and we found it too late in our development for us to use it.
